#### 	► Pedestrian Detection

- OpenCV's default people detector has been used.
- Video available [here]().

#### 	► Vehicle Detection (with SVMLight)

- Training images are extracted from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNCJQkvALVc).
- Classification and feature vector files couldn't be uploaded because they were containing too much data.

#### ► Vehicle Detection (with Haar Cascades)

- The trained Haar classifier is based on cars3.xml created by Brad Philip and Paul Updike.
- Video available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhndtzWhhBY).

#### ► Vehicle Detection (with HOG)

- Video available [here](https://youtu.be/kWjSz0JImwg).
